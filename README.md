# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Repository

Welcome to the PCA Algorithm repository, another chapter in my journey through machine learning algorithms, as chronicled on my blog [Data Science For Lifelong Learning](https://datasciencelifelonglearn.blogspot.com). This repository is meticulously designed to provide both beginners and seasoned professionals with an in-depth understanding of the PCA algorithm, its applications, and its pivotal role in dimensionality reduction.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a cornerstone in the vast realm of data science and machine learning. It's a method that transforms potentially correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated ones. This repository not only offers a hands-on Python implementation of PCA but also dives deep into its mechanics, benefits, and potential challenges. By blending theoretical insights with practical demonstrations, the content here aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of PCA.

## Repository Structure

- **[Implementation](./Implementation/Readme.md)**: A comprehensive exploration of the PCA algorithm, discussing its methodology, applications, and intricacies.

- **[Code](./Implementation/Code/)**: Python scripts that implement PCA. For a detailed breakdown of the codebase, refer to the [Code Readme](./Implementation/Code/Readme.md).
  
- **[Images](./Implementation/Images/)**: Contains visual assets and graphical results related to PCA.

## Python Implementation

The codebase is crafted with precision, ensuring modularity and clarity for easy adaptation.

- **Data Generation**: [create_dataset.py](./Implementation/Code/create_dataset.py)
- **PCA Algorithm**: [pca_function.py](./Implementation/Code/pca_function.py)
- **Visualization**: [visualize_results.py](./Implementation/Code/visualize_results.py)
- **Demonstration**: [pca_demo.py](./Implementation/Code/pca_demo.py)

## Getting Started

To experience the PCA demonstration:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Code` directory.
