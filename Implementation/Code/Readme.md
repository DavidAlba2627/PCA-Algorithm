# PCA Algorithm: Codebase Overview

Welcome to the technical segment of my PCA repository. This directory encapsulates the Python implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, a fundamental technique in dimensionality reduction and data visualization. The scripts housed here are the culmination of rigorous development and testing, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. They serve not only as a demonstration of the algorithm's capabilities but also as a modular foundation for further exploration or adaptation in diverse applications.

## File Structure

1. **create_dataset.py**: Generates a bivariate dataset and provides a function to standardize the data. Standardizing the dataset is crucial for PCA as it ensures that each feature has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, making the data suitable for PCA.

2. **pca_function.py**: Contains the custom implementation of the PCA algorithm. This script provides the core logic for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variance as possible.

3. **visualize_results.py**: Offers utility functions to visualize the original dataset, the dataset reduced using PCA, and the principal components on the original dataset. It provides a clear comparison between the original data, its transformed version, and the principal components that capture the most variance.

4. **pca_demo.py**: This script ties everything together. It demonstrates the PCA dimensionality reduction process using the custom implementation on the standardized dataset. The results, including the original dataset, reduced dataset, and the visualized principal components, are showcased using functions from `visualize_results.py`.

## Usage

To experience the PCA algorithm in action:

- Execute the `pca_demo.py` script.
